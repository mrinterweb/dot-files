dot-files
=========

Sean&#39;s personal dot files.

I keep my favorite configuration files here because I tend to bounce between machines frequently. A little bit of consistency between machines helps me keep what little sanity I have left.

The reason why my dot files repo is better than the rest,
is because I have an awesome rake task that symlinks everything and reports statuses all with pretty colors!
It will even show conflicts with files that are unlinked.

Fun Stuff Like...

* .vimrc
  * UlitSnip snippets
* .tmux.conf
* .zshrc
* handy scripts

Usage
-----

To link just run:

rake
